# Neural-Backed-Decision-Trees-NBDT-
Explainable ML

The objective of the project is to improve the interpretability/explainability of computer vision models by combining neural networks (for low-level decisions) with decision trees (for high level interpretability). CIFAR-10 Object Recognition in Images dataset has been used which consists of 60,000 images of 10 different classes. Image Data loaded through data loader and transformed to normalize them into the same shape. WideResNet model used for image identification. Decision tree hierarchy was built and assigned labels to intermediate nodes using WordNet. Interpretability was achieved along with 90% accuracy.
